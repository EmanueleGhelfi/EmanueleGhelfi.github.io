**Great news!**

The [Zuru](https://zuru.tech) **ML Team** (me, Federico Di Mattia, Paolo Galeone, Michele De Simoni) will present the tutorial: **"Deep Diving into GANs: From Theory to Production with TensorFlow 2.0"** at [EuroSciPy](https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2019/talk/Q79NND/) in Bilbao, the 2nd of September 2019.

This tutorial builds upon the [PyConX](https://www.pycon.it/conference/talks/deep-diving-into-gans-form-theory-to-production) (see also [here](https://emanueleghelfi.github.io/blog/2019/05/06/pyconx-gans.html) for more details) training with some differences.

We will be showcasing all the shiny new APIs introduced by TensorFlow 2.0 by showing how to build a GAN from scratch and how to "productionize" it by leveraging the [AshPy](https://github.com/zurutech/ashpy) (see also [here](https://emanueleghelfi.github.io/blog/2019/08/01/ashpy.html) for more details) Python package that allows to easily **design**, **prototype**, **train** and **export** Machine Learning models defined in [TensorFlow 2.0](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta).

The workshop is composed of:

- Theoretical introduction
- **GANs** from Scratch in **TensorFlow 2.0**
- High-performance input data pipeline with [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets)
- Introduction to the [AshPy](https://github.com/zurutech/ashpy) API
- Implementing, training, and visualizing DCGAN using **AshPy**
- Production deployment using Google Cloud ML Engine and Google Cloud Functions

The materials of the workshop will be openly provided via GitHub (see [here](https://github.com/zurutech/gans-from-theory-to-production)) prior to the event and will be run on Colab leveraging the free GPU.
