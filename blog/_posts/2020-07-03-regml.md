I attented the course [Regularization Methods for Machine Learning](http://lcsl.mit.edu/courses/regml/regml2020/) (RegML 2020).

Topics:

- Regularization Methods: Penalization, Projection, Early Stopping.
- Kernel Methods
- Regularization in Multi-Task Learning
- Sparsity
- Geometric Deep Learning
- Representation Learning

[Here](https://www.notion.so/RegML-998736a4db4b483a8a8c1cce43e54563) you can find my notes about the lessons. There can be errors, imprecisions and so on. They are still in progress.

[Here](https://github.com/EmanueleGhelfi/RegML) you can find my repository with the solutions of some of the exercises presented during the course.
