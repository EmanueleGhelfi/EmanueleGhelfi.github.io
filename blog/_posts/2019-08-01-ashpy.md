[AshPy](www.github.com/zurutech/ashpy) is a TensorFlow 2.0 library for (**distributed**) training, evaluation, model selection, and fast prototyping.
It is designed to ease the burden of setting up all the nuances of the architectures built to train complex custom deep learning models.

## AshPy, why?

Ashpy provides already prepared trainers for classifier models and GANs. In particular, in regards of the latter, it offers a basic GAN sarchitecture with a Generator-Discriminator structure and an enhanced GAN architecture version made up of a Encoder-Generator-Discriminator structure.
In general **AshPy** aims to:

- Rapid model prototyping
- Enforcement of best practices & API consistency
- Remove duplicated and boilerplate code
- General usability by new project

## AshPy, where?

The first version of AshPy is available on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/ashpy/), you can install it in your virtualenv with `pip install ashpy`.

Here some useful links:

- **Documentation**: [ashpy.zurutech.io](https://ashpy.zurutech.io)
- **Github**: [zurutech/ashpy](https://github.com/zurutech/ashpy)

AshPy is created and maintained primarily by the ML & CV Lab @ [Zuru Tech](https://zuru.tech).
