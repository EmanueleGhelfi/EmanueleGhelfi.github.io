        <title>Reinforcement Learning in Configurable Continuous Environments</title>
        <description>
          
          Paper Poster Slides Code Most of the problems tackled by Reinforcement Learning are typically modeled as Markov Decision Processes in which the environment is considered a fixed entity and cannot be controlled. Nevertheless, there exist several real-world examples in which a partial control on the environment can be exercised by...

        <title>PyCon X - GANs: From Theory to Production</title>
        <description>
          
          Me and my colleagues (Federico Di Mattia, Paolo Galeone, Michele De Simoni) held the training: “Deep Diving into GANs: From Theory To Production” at PyCon X in Florence. GANs are the new hottest topic in the ML arena; however, they present a challenge for the researchers and the engineers alike....

        <title>Learning To Run</title>
        <description>
          
          Paper Slides In this article we present our approach for the NIPS 2017 ”Learning To Run” challenge. The goal of the challenge is to develop a controller able to run in a complex environment, by training a model with Deep Reinforcement Learning methods. We follow the approach of the team...

        <title>Every Experiment is Sacred</title>
        <description>
          
          Managing Machine Learning experiments is usually painful. The usual workflow when approaching a problem using Machine Learning tools is the following. You study the problem, define a possible solution, then you implement that solution and measure its quality. Often the solution depends on some parameters, and we refer to the...
