<p>This format is deliberately inspired by <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/about/">Adrian Colyer</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes">Denny Britz</a> and <a href="https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes">Daniel Takeshi</a>.</p>

<p>The series <strong>Paper Notes</strong> will contain the notes about papers Iâ€™ve read. This can be useful for people trying to understand better some mysterious paper and it can be very useful for me to obtain a deeper understanding of papers. I will review mostly papers about Machine Learning, especially GANs, Reinforcement Learning and Computer Vision. I will try to implement the most important part of them or at least to share the implementation. I will provide all links and related material.</p>
